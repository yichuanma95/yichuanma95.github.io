        </header>
        <p>I was born on December 6, 1995 in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, PR China. I immigrated to the US in June 1999 with my parents, and we first lived in Lexington, Kentucky for about a year, before moving to Charlottesville, Virginia, home to the University of Virginia, where I lived, spending my elementary and middle school years, until July 2010. Since then, I am now living in Lexington, Massachusetts, where I attended high school (LHS Class of 2014). We had occassionally returned to the old country throughout this time.</p>
        <p>I am currently a junior majoring in Computer Science at Tufts University's School of Engineering. I have already taken COMP 11, 15, 20, 40, 86, 105, and 160, and am now in 97, 135, and 170. I have also taken ES 93-4 (with Soha Hassoun), ES2, ES3, ES4, and MATH 61. This bio here that you're currently reading is on a webpage for COMP 20.</p>
        <p>I had played piano for 5 years, from the beginning of 4th grade to the end of 8th grade. I had also played violin throughout my middle and high school years, for a total of 7 years, playing in my school's orchestras in each of those years. I was also a member of my high school's championship-winning Boys' Swim Team.</p>
        <p>I am a supporter of all 4 of Boston's major sports teams, that is the Celtics, Bruins, Red Sox, and the Patriots. Not only do I take pride in these teams and their accomplishments and titles, but I also take pride in living in, or near, the proud, historic, hardworking city of Boston. In addition, I support FC Barcelona. My favorite individual athletes include Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, David Ortiz, Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr., Luis Su&#225;rez, and more. I also like Mickey Mouse.</p>
        <p>I am fluent in Mandarin, and am also learning Fran&#231;ais because I have an interest in the language and culture.</p>
        <p>My interests are music, particularly the violin, photography, programming and software development, going into Boston, problem solving, Chinese culture, different world cultures, travelling to new places, and thinking about the meaning of life.</p>
