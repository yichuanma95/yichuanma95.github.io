        <p>I was born on December 6, 1995 in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, PR China. I immigrated to the US in June 1999 with my parents, and we first lived in Lexington, Kentucky for about a year, before moving to Charlottesville, Virginia, home to the University of Virginia, where I lived, spending my elementary and middle school years, until July 2010. I am currently living in Lexington, Massachusetts, where I attended high school (LHS Class of 2014). We had occassionally returned to the old country throughout this time.</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from Tufts University's School of Engineering with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science, <i>magna cum laude</i>. My capstone project for my senior year was on the testing and acceleration of the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2945" class="bioLinks">RFC 2945</a>, which primarily focused on implementing a faster and more parallel Modular Exponentiation (MODPOW) operation that could run on the GPU. My partner and I wrote that program in C with the CUDA C API, mainly used for writing parallel programs that could run on computers with nVIDIA-built, CUDA-capable graphics cards. My other coursework at Tufts included cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, web programming, probability and statistics with R, and computational design with MATLAB.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 2017, I was a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.trinetx.com" class="bioLinks">TriNetX</a>. There I used SQL and R to perform analytics and present the results to the product management team to help them make decisions on proposing new features for the TriNetX app. I closely monitored a static analysis program called SonarQube to fix issues in the app's Java codebase, which resulted in fewer irrelevant error logs for the engineering team and an improved backend. Plus, I wrote tests in Javascript and ran them on a tool called Cypress.io to test the beta version of their app's frontend.</p>
        <p>I had played piano for 5 years, from the beginning of 4th grade to the end of 8th grade. I had also played violin throughout my middle and high school years, for a total of 7 years, playing in my school's orchestras in each of those years. I was also a member of my high school's championship-winning Boys' Swim Team.</p>
        <p>I am a supporter of all 4 of Boston's major sports teams, that is the Celtics, Bruins, Red Sox, and the Patriots. Not only do I take pride in these teams and their accomplishments and titles, but I also take pride in living in, or near, the proud, historic, hardworking city of Boston. In addition, I support FC Barcelona. My favorite individual athletes include Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski, David Ortiz, Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr., Luis Su&#225;rez, and more. I also like Mickey Mouse.</p>
        <p>I am fluent in Mandarin, and am also learning Fran&#231;ais because I have an interest in the language and culture. I hope to go to Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>My personal interests include trains, especially the fast ones in Europe and East Asia (those are genuine trains that America badly needs and sourly lacks), photography, programming and software development, going into Boston, problem solving, Chinese culture, different world cultures, travelling to new places, and thinking about the meaning of life.</p>
        <p>As of now, I have NO interest in relocating away from the Boston area, except for across the pond.</p>
